204: Aggressive downsampling is also a means for computa-

206: predictions from 1×1, 2×2, 4×4, 8×8, and 16×16 feature

208: Network (PPN) architecture [7] implies that additional com-

210: map resolution.

212: A key feature speciﬁc to GPU as opposed to CPU com-
213: putation is a noticeable ﬁxed cost of dispatching a particular
214: layer computation, which becomes relatively signiﬁcant for
215: deep low-resolution layers inherent to popular CPU-tailored
216: architectures. As an example, in one experiment we ob-
217: served that out of 4.9 ms of MobileNetV1 inference time
218: only 3.9 ms were spent in actual GPU shader computation.
219: Taking this into consideration, we have adopted an al-
220: ternative anchor scheme that stops at the 8×8 feature map
221: dimensions without further downsampling (Figure 2). We
222: have replaced 2 anchors per pixel in each of the 8×8, 4×4
223: and 2×2 resolutions by 6 anchors at 8×8. Due to the limited
224: variance in human face aspect ratios, limiting the anchors
225: to the 1:1 aspect ratio was found sufﬁcient for accurate face
226: detection.
